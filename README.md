The code based on the Witcher universe done by me on C++ during the 3rd year of Bachelor in 2020 during the OOP lecture.
It was necessary to write a simple code using inheritance feature of OOP, but back in the day I decided to make it a bit more complicated and funnier.

The main story is that there was a class "Human", then the "Witcher" class, which inherits the attributes from the "Human". There were several other classes: "Horse", "Witcher Horseman", - his usage of signs, the difference between him walking or running, the difference between a silver and a steel sword etc. were also present.
